'''
Create a deformable model by preprocessing landmark data
using GPA and PCA. Based on shape parameters b and eigenvectors P,
the model can construct variations of a mean using the equation:

    x = mean + P*b (see Cootes p.6 eq.2)
    OR
    x = mean + P*diag(eigenvals)*b (see Blanz p.2 eq.7) (=scaled eigenvectors)

Used in the Active Shape Model environment. The Active Shape Model
is then the fit function that iteratively searches for the best
parameters.
